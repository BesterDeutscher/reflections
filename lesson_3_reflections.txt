When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working from more than one computer or when several people are working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    New changes might have been introduced by other people before you are ready to pull them.

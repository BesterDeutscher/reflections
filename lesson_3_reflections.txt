When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working from more than one computer or when several people are working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    New changes might have been introduced by other people before you are ready to pull them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A branch is a way to have a project deviate in two directions to try out various things and that can be merged together again later on. A clone copies a branch from another repository that can be located either locally or on GitHub. A fork is a clone from GitHub to GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    This way you are up-to-date on the project's current progress.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub, I would collaborate by sending the newest version of the code via email back and forth between the collaborators. Or you can simply work together at the same time and place. Using Git or GitHub would probably be easier and the other ways would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    You would want to make changes in a separate branch when you are collaborating and want to show the changes to others first. That has the benefit of allowing everyone to keep up-to-date on the current state of master. The other approach has the benefit of being less complicated.

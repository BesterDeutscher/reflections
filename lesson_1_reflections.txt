How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it more easy to compare by pointing out the parts that were different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can more easily compare different versions and find where it all went wrong.
    You're less likely to be afraid of making some changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: You can choose more appropriate points
    Con: You gotta do it yourself

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They were made with different purposes in mind. Git is more for programming, which often means several interdependent files. Google Docs is more about individual files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" lets you see a list of all the versions so far with comments and "git diff" plus two IDs lets you see the differences between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can try out anything without having to worry because you can just revert it back to how it was before.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using it to get to become familiar with it.
